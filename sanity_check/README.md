In this challenge we are given a hex address 0x5CDd53b4dFe8AE92d73F40894C67c1a6da82032d and are told that it is an address on the ethereum rinkeby test network

We can go to the rinkeby network and search for this address

There, we can look at the contract on this address and copy the hex data there

Translating it we can find our flag among some garbage data

flag{1t_1s_jus7_th3_st@rt}
